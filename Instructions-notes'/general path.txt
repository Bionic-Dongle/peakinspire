The Real Setup (Not WordPress Themes!)
Your HTML Templates = Static Sites

Hub site: Pure HTML/CSS (what we built)
Subdomains: Your pamphlet templates (also pure HTML/CSS)
WordPress: ONLY as a content management backend
ZimmWriter: Feeds content TO WordPress
Automation: Pulls content FROM WordPress, injects into your HTML templates

The Workflow:

ZimmWriter creates content → WordPress (headless CMS)
Automation pulls from WordPress API → Your HTML templates
Deploy static HTML files to hosting
Zero WordPress themes involved!

You keep your beautiful design, WordPress just stores the content.

Automation Roadmap - Everything Mappable:
Content Creation (ZimmWriter)
Personal Mode:

Weekly journey updates
Product testing logs
Melbourne discoveries
Health experiments

Generic Mode:

SEO-optimized reviews
Buying guides
Comparison articles
Seasonal content

Content Distribution Chain:

ZimmWriter → WordPress API (content storage)
WordPress API → HTML template injection
Static files → Hosting deployment
Same content → YouTube script
Same content → Pinterest descriptions
Same content → Email newsletter

What Can Be Automated:

Content generation (ZimmWriter)
Template population (API calls)
File deployment (Git/FTP)
Social media posting (Buffer)
Email campaigns (Mailchimp)
SEO optimization (meta tags, schemas)
Image optimization
Affiliate link management

Question: Should I map out the exact technical workflow for ZimmWriter → WordPress API → Your HTML templates? That's the missing piece you need before Monday.
The key is: Your design stays pure, WordPress just becomes a content database.

Headless WordPress Plugin Advantages:
Content Management Plugins:

ACF (Advanced Custom Fields): Perfect for your review templates (rating fields, price fields, pros/cons)
Yoast SEO: Handles meta tags, schema markup via API
WP All Import: Bulk import content from ZimmWriter

Functionality Plugins:

WP Maps: Google Maps integration via API
Gravity Forms: Advanced forms (exposed via API)
WooCommerce: If you want to sell your own products later
Custom Post Types: Organize reviews, journey posts, local guides separately

Your Workflow with Headless + Plugins:

ZimmWriter creates content → WordPress admin
ACF fields capture structured data (ratings, prices, affiliate links)
Plugins process (SEO optimization, maps, etc.)
WordPress REST API outputs clean JSON
Your automation grabs JSON → injects into your HTML templates
Deploy static HTML files

Best of Both Worlds:

Your beautiful HTML design (no WordPress themes)
WordPress power (plugins, user management, content organization)
Plugin ecosystem (maps, forms, SEO tools)
Static site speed (final output is HTML/CSS/JS)

Technical Setup:

WordPress install (backend only)
REST API enabled
CORS headers for your domain
Authentication for content management

Want me to outline the exact technical implementation for:

WordPress headless setup
Content API structure for your templates
ZimmWriter → WordPress integration

This is the sweet spot - plugin power without theme hell!
